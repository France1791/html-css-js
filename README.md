# html-css
this a repo of some of my html,css and js projects. they are not my own projects, they from codeCamp and I'm just using them for practice.
One is the first project I did, a basic cat photo app build with HTML
Second one is a project realized with HTML and CSS
The third one is a about me project I'm working on, it's a long term project about creating my own website where you can have an idea of who I am where I come from, my aspirations, my fears and what I'm working on in the present moment
